### 👋

Hello! I'm Dave.

**Check out my train "game", Trains.NET: https://wengier.com/Trains.NET/**

Professionally, I work on the Razor Tooling team at Microsoft making Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code better for Razor and Blazor developers everywhere. I used to be part of the Roslyn team, doing the same thing for C# and VB developers, and can occasionally be found poking my nose in there from time to time.

Unprofessionally, I _(Ed: used to)_ stream on Twitch every Wednesday night at 8:30pm Australian Eastern Time, working on my train game/simulation/distraction called [Trains.NET](https://github.com/davidwengier/Trains.NET). You can follow along on Twitch at [https://www.twitch.tv/davidwengier](https://www.twitch.tv/davidwengier) and every stream is uploaded to YouTube afterwards in the [Trains.NET playlist](https://bit.ly/trains-net-videos). If you want to chat about the project you can [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2WvKkq). I'm also a member of [The Live Coders](https://livecoders.dev/) stream team.

The best way to reach me is probably to follow me on Bluesky at [@david.wengier.com](https://bsky.app/profile/david.wengier.com) or Mastodon where I am [@davidwengier@aus.social](https://aus.social/@davidwengier). Technically I have a website at [https://wengier.com](https://wengier.com) but at time of writing, that just redirects here. I hate blogging and have never been very good at it. If you want to extract information from my brain, feel free to invite me onto your podcast :)
