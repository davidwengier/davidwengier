Hello! I'm Dave.

Professionally, I work on the Roslyn IDE team at Microsoft making Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac better for C# and VB developers everywhere.

Unprofessionally, I stream on Twitch every Wednesday night at 8:30pm Australian Eastern Time, working on my train game/simulation/distraction called [Trains.NET](https://github.com/davidwengier/Trains.NET). You can follow along on Twitch at [https://www.twitch.tv/davidwengier](https://www.twitch.tv/davidwengier) and every stream is uploaded to YouTube afterwards in the [Trains.NET playlist](https://bit.ly/trains-net-videos). If you want to chat about the project you can [Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/Z2WvKkq). I'm also a member of [The Live Coders](https://livecoders.dev/) stream team.

The best way to reach me is probably to follow me on Twitter where I am also [@davidwengier](https://twitter.com/davidwengier). Technically I have a website at [https://wengier.com](https://wengier.com) but its not exactly the most active site on the Internet that's for sure.
